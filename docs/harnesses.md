# Harnesses — advanced behavior

The **harness** is the coding-agent CLI that runs your skills. The README's
[Harnesses](../.github/README.md#harnesses) section covers the basics — the two
first-class harnesses (`claude` default, `grok`), how to select one, and
one-click X-account login. This page collects the deeper behavior for anyone
running the `grok` harness in anger.

## Additional harnesses via run-harness (`codex`, `pi`, `vibe`, `kimi`)

Four more harnesses are selectable in the dashboard's harness dropdown and the
`harness:` config: **codex** (OpenAI Codex CLI), **pi** (Pi Coding Agent),
**vibe** (Mistral Vibe) and **kimi** (Moonshot Kimi). Unlike `claude`/`grok`
they don't have a bespoke branch in the workflow — they run through
[`harness-adapter`](../harness-adapter/)'s `run-harness`, which wraps each CLI in
the same Claude-Code-shaped `{result, usage, session_id}` contract that
`scripts/run-grok.sh` provides, so everything downstream (scoring, token
accounting, memory, notifications) is unchanged.

All four authenticate with a single **`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`** — set it in
Settings and every one of them works. Their model picker offers OpenRouter ids
rather than the `claude-*`/`grok-*` ids, and the model you pick is what actually
runs. Each of these harnesses carries its own curated list (`CODEX_MODELS` /
`VIBE_MODELS` / `PI_MODELS` / `KIMI_MODELS`): **codex**
defaults to `openai/gpt-5-mini` (it fails on `gpt-5-nano`) and also offers the
codex-tuned line (`gpt-5.1-codex-mini`, `gpt-5.3-codex`) and the general
`gpt-5.6` family (`luna`, `terra`); **vibe**'s generic `ProviderConfig` drives any
OpenRouter model, so it defaults to `mistralai/mistral-medium-3-5` and offers
`deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`; **pi** (litellm `openrouter/<slug>` routing) runs the
DeepSeek V4 pair — `deepseek-v4-flash` (default) and `deepseek-v4-pro`; **kimi** is
Moonshot, so it runs Moonshot's own Kimi family through OpenRouter —
`moonshotai/kimi-k2.5` (default), `kimi-k3` (strongest, ~2× slower), and
`kimi-k2.7-code`. The scorer
routes through the same harness the skill
ran on, so a repo with **no** Claude credentials still gets every run scored.

### Native auth — run on your own provider account

OpenRouter is the shared fallback; each harness can also run on its **own**
provider, the same way `grok` runs on your X-account session. Two have real
login flows captured for CI (the exact `GROK_CREDENTIALS` pattern — drive the
login locally, store the session as a repo secret, restore it on the runner):

| harness | native auth | how to set it |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `codex` | **ChatGPT** OAuth | `aeon auth --harness codex` (or dashboard **Connect ChatGPT**) → `CODEX_AUTH`. Or an OpenAI key: `--key sk-…` → `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| `kimi`  | **Moonshot** device login | `aeon auth --harness kimi` (or **Connect Kimi**) → `KIMI_AUTH`. Or `--key` → `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` |
| `pi`    | provider API key | `aeon auth --harness pi --key <sk-ant-…\|sk-…>` → the matching `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` (auto-detected) |
| `vibe`  | Mistral key | `aeon auth --harness vibe --key <key>` → `MISTRAL_API_KEY` (vibe's default provider) |

Which one runs is decided at dispatch by **which secret is set**, native first,
OpenRouter last (`authSecretsForHarness` / the `HARNESS_AUTH` registry in
`apps/dashboard/lib/harness-auth.ts`). On native auth the harness uses its **own
default model** — the OpenRouter model picker only applies when the run falls
back to `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (an `openai/*` id would be the wrong provider
otherwise). The workflow's *Install harness CLI* step restores/configures the
selected provider; the CLI + dashboard flows share `lib/harness-auth-server.ts`.

The full deployment runbook — the added/modified workflow steps, per-harness
install and config, runner gotchas (AppArmor, the codex pin), and the measured
reasons `opencode`/`copilot`/`agy` are excluded — is
[`harness-adapter/docs/aeon-integration.md`](../harness-adapter/docs/aeon-integration.md).

## Verification status

All six harnesses were verified end-to-end through `run-harness` on **2026-07-22**
— each dispatched live on GitHub Actions, exercising auth, read-only enforcement,
token accounting, and the post-run health scorer:

| harness | auth as-tested | read-only enforcement | token usage | live result |
|---------|----------------|-----------------------|-------------|-------------|
| `claude` | `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | allowlist-strip + post-run revert (`--no-sandbox`) | real | green, both modes |
| `grok` | `GROK_CREDENTIALS` (X-OAuth) | allowlist-strip + post-run revert (`--no-sandbox`) | real | scored 4/5 |
| `codex` | OpenRouter (`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) | wrapper OS sandbox (codex's own sandbox off in read-only to avoid nesting) | real | 5/5 on `gpt-5-mini`, real fetch verified |
| `pi` | OpenRouter | wrapper OS sandbox | real | 5/5 on `gpt-5-mini` |
| `vibe` | OpenRouter | wrapper sandbox + `--disabled-tools write_file,edit` | char/4 estimate | 4/5 on `gpt-5-mini` |
| `kimi` | OpenRouter | wrapper OS sandbox (its only read-only guard) | char/4 estimate | Kimi K3 5/5, K2.5 & K2.7-code 4/5 — slates verified real |

Notes from the sweep:

- **Model matters for the score.** `pi`/`vibe` scored 2/5 on `gpt-5-nano` (the model
  punted / truncated) but 5/5 and 4/5 on `gpt-5-mini` — the harness scoring path is
  sound; nano was just too weak for the task.
- **Auth precedence is a trap.** codex resolves `CODEX_AUTH` → `OPENAI_API_KEY` →
  OpenRouter and grok resolves `GROK_CREDENTIALS` → `XAI_API_KEY`, **native-first** —
  so a stale or quota-dead native secret keeps failing even when a working fallback
  is present. Delete the native secret to fall through. Deleting `CODEX_AUTH` is also
  how you pin a cheap model: the OpenRouter path forwards `-f model=openai/gpt-5-*`,
  while native auth uses the harness's own (pricier) default.
- **The scorer grades stdout, not `./notify`.** A run that routes its deliverable
  into a channel and leaves a thin final message is under-graded even though the
  work was real (observed on codex/`gpt-5-mini`, which narrated pessimistically in
  stdout while its full slate went to notify). Keep the substance in the run's final
  message.

Fixes shipped during the sweep: harness unification through `run-harness` (#2),
codex read-only inline notify (#4), keep-substance-in-stdout guidance (#5),
kimi/vibe token estimate (#6), grok scorer fallback to `grok-4.5` (#7), and
codex read-only under the wrapper sandbox so fetches work (#14 — its native
`--sandbox read-only` was also blocking the network).

## Token accounting

Every harness runs through `run-harness`, which normalizes usage into the
Claude-Code `{input, output, cache_read, cache_creation}` shape. What each CLI
exposes differs:

- **claude, grok, codex, pi** report **real** usage. grok's adapter uses
  `--output-format streaming-json`, whose terminal `{"type":"end"}` event carries
  input/output/cache tokens + cost (`harness-adapter/adapters/grok.sh`) — the older
  `scripts/run-grok.sh` plain-`json` path reported 0, but the unified adapter does
  not.
- **kimi and vibe** expose **no** usage field (kimi's `stream-json` and vibe's
  `--output json` carry none — verified live), so their adapters fall back to a
  transparent `char/4` **estimate** of the assembled input + result rather than a
  misleading `0/0/0`; real counts always win if a future build emits them.

The captured OAuth sessions (grok's `GROK_CREDENTIALS`, codex's `CODEX_AUTH`) can
expire — if unattended runs start failing on auth, re-capture via the dashboard
(**Connect X account** / **Connect ChatGPT**) or switch to the API-key path.

## Capability mode carries over unchanged

A `mode: read-only` skill maps to grok's `--sandbox read-only` with a read-only
allowlist; `write` adds `Edit` + `git`/`gh`/`python` — the same drops as on
Claude Code (`scripts/skill_mode.sh grok-args`). Enforcement is the explicit
allowlist plus the read-only sandbox: a headless run has no prompt path, so any
tool not on the allowlist and not a read-class fast-path is refused. Grok Build
has no free tier — it needs a SuperGrok / X Premium+ subscription (OAuth) or xAI
API credits (`XAI_API_KEY`).

## Standing instructions

Grok loads `CLAUDE.md` natively (it reads Claude Code's memory files), so the
operating manual is **not** duplicated. `AGENTS.md` is generated by
`scripts/gen-agents-md.js` and carries only `STRATEGY.md` — the one thing
`CLAUDE.md` delivers via the Claude-only `@STRATEGY.md` import, which grok doesn't
expand. That trims ~2.5k tokens of duplicate context per grok run vs. mirroring
the whole manual.

## MCP works on grok

Grok discovers the project `.mcp.json` natively (walking cwd→git-root) and
expands `${VAR}` from the environment — the same secrets the workflow's MCP
preflight resolves. `scripts/run-grok.sh` adds one `--allow 'MCPTool(<server>__*)'`
per server so the model can actually call the tools (MCP tools aren't
auto-approved under a headless run). No `--mcp-config` flag or schema translation
is needed. (On a dev machine grok additionally sees your user-global MCP servers
from `~/.claude.json`/`~/.cursor/mcp.json`; CI runners are clean, so only the
repo's `.mcp.json` applies.)

## Newer grok knobs (opt-in per skill)

A skill's `SKILL.md` frontmatter can shape the grok run — ignored by the Claude
harness:

```yaml
max_turns: 120     # agentic-turn cap (default 60; a runaway/cost guard) → --max-turns
best_of_n: 3       # run the task 3 ways in parallel, keep the best      → --best-of-n
verify: true       # append a self-verification loop before finishing    → --check
effort: high       # low|medium|high|xhigh|max → --effort  (reasoning models only)
```

`effort`/`reasoning_effort` map to the API's `reasoningEffort`, honoured by
`grok-4.5` — a reasoning model, and the only model the X-account login exposes to
the CLI (see [Verification status](#verification-status); other xAI model ids are
api.x.ai strings the CLI rejects as "unknown model id"). `best_of_n`/`verify` build
on grok's subagents (so the harness drops `--no-subagents` for those runs);
`verify` can't combine with structured output. `run-grok.sh` also understands
`GROK_JSON_SCHEMA` for `--json-schema` structured output (reliably honoured by
`grok-4.5`).

## Every entry point runs on either harness

The harness split isn't just the scheduled skill run — it's wired through every
surface that launches the agent, so a grok-only fork (no Claude credentials)
behaves identically everywhere:

| Surface | How grok is selected | Notes |
|---------|---------------------|-------|
| Scheduled / manual skill run (`aeon.yml`) | dispatch **Harness** input → per-skill `harness:` → global `harness:` → `claude` | full flags + MCP + scorer |
| Skill chains (`chain-runner.yml`) | inherits — each step dispatches `aeon.yml`, which resolves per-skill/global | |
| Inbound messages (`messages.yml`, Telegram/Discord/Slack) | global `harness:` in `aeon.yml` | conversational reply in write mode |
| Local MCP server (`apps/mcp-server`) | `AEON_HARNESS` env → global `harness:` | `resolveHarness()` in `skill-executor.ts` |
| Webhook (`apps/webhook`) | relay only → dispatches `messages.yml` | harness-agnostic |
| Post-run quality scorer (`aeon.yml`) | scores through the same harness the skill ran on | |

Two surfaces stay Claude-only **by design**: the **AI gateway**
(`scripts/llm-gateway.sh`) only reshapes the model behind Claude Code — grok has
its own auth and bypasses it — and the **json-render feed** (`notify-jsonrender`)
renders via `claude -p` and is skipped on grok (the feed is a display nicety;
skill output, memory, and notifications are unaffected).
