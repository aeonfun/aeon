# Knowledge — topics index

Durable knowledge notes live under `memory/topics/`, one concept per markdown file.

# Reference

- [Base RPC access from the runner](/topics/base-rpc-access.md) — the one keyless endpoint that works, its 1,000-block `eth_getLogs` cap, and how to tell a quiet window from a broken query.
## Tokens

- [Note Systems (NOTE)](tokens/note-systems.md) — Robinhood Chain 4663 结构化票据代币；timelock 持 25.42%，48h 延迟解锁，owner 为单个 EOA
- [DEUS / xDEUS watch addresses](/topics/deus-escrow.md) — token, escrow, and xDEUS NFT addresses; why xDEUS being an ERC-721 needs no config change; stake/unstake pairing.
- [Scheduler & notification plumbing](/topics/ops-plumbing.md) — how to prove scheduled dispatch actually fires, and why to write plain Markdown in `./notify`.
- [price-alert state file contract](/topics/price-alert-state.md) — what each field in `price-alert-state.json` means and why targets must be pre-seeded.
