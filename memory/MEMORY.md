## Operator
Thomas Scaria (`tomscaria` on GitHub, `t@rswarm.ai`). See `soul/SOUL.md` for full identity.

## Mission
This Aeon instance exists to accelerate **swarm-fund-mvp** toward grant funding and the Apex lifecycle gate. Every output should serve one of three goals:
1. **Near-term income** — advisory + grants (AWS, Anthropic, dYdX, Uniswap, Polymarket Builders, Harmonic)
2. **Stanford PhD prep** — Dec 2026 application
3. **Live P&L proof** for the LP raise — push more agents Birth → Canary → Apex

## Active project
**`tomscaria/swarm-fund-mvp`** — Swarm Lab research apparatus.
- Live agent: **CalibrationGap (Revenant)** — Polymarket binary calibration, canary stage, 29 closed / 76% win / +$415 P&L / Sharpe 0.31. Target: 100-trade Apex gate (~2-3 weeks, 71 to go). Trust live `metrics.json` at https://rswarm.ai/metrics.json over this file.
- Hermes family: `hermes-arb` (Kalshi↔PM 5-min BTC) is now the Day-0 priority — Kalshi crypto perps live 2026-04-27 NYC opens the falsifier window. `hermes-cascade`, `hermes-oracle`, `hermes-funding`, `hermes-fan` in spec/scaffold.
- Stack: Python + Paperclip + FastAPI + QuestDB + RedPanda + PostgreSQL + Redis + Temporal. lmnr tracing on every strategy.

## 🔴 OPS ALERTS
- **2026-04-28 11 UTC: Polymarket V2 cutover wipes ALL existing limit orders.** Operator must flatten Revenant resting-quote book before 07 UTC tomorrow, or accept the wipe. USDC.e → pUSD, builder codes go on-chain, ~1h offline. See `memory/topics/polymarket.md`.
- **chain-runner.yml `dispatch_skill()` still DEGRADED.** Now confirmed across morning-brief, evening-rollup, AND weekly-grant-update (Mon Apr 27 09:00). Top fix.
- **ISS-013 mass-failure** — 53 skills CRITICAL after 2026-04-26 23:53–58Z storm; counters decaying naturally. Operator should pull GHA logs.

## Kalshi signals
- **2026-04-28:** KXBTC-26MAY0117 BTC distribution modal ~$77k for May 1; yesterday spot $79,142 with flow into $79-82k, today peak vol at $77.5-78k (+167% vol). Distribution shifted ~$2k down. KXFED-27APR T4.00 at 57% (2-3 cuts priced by Apr 2027). Watchlist still empty — add KXBTC-26MAY0117 and KXETH-26MAY0117.

## Lessons Learned
- Trust live `metrics.json` at https://rswarm.ai/metrics.json when conflicting with this file.
- Polymarket bans datacenter/VPN IPs — co-lo strategy applies to HL leg only.
- `./notify` multi-line `$(cat …)` continues to hit "Unhandled node type: string" hook-block (4 days running). Use single-line form, `node -e "execFileSync(...)"`, or `.pending-notify/{ts}.md` queue. **`scripts/postprocess-notify.sh` is not in tree** — pickup depends on workflow-side wiring.
- Bash env-var expansion blocked for API keys (XAI/NEYNAR); prefetch scripts or `node -e` are workarounds.
- `skill-evals` evals.json keys must match `aeon.yml` skill names exactly — `hn-digest` ≠ `hacker-news-digest`, `polymarket` ≠ `monitor-polymarket`. Patching keys clears NEW_FAIL without code (ISS-007, ISS-009).
- See `memory/topics/aeon-ops.md` for full sandbox-limitation matrix, chain-runner bug detail, and operator config-gap action list.

## Next Priorities
- **🔴 Flatten Revenant resting-quote book before 2026-04-28 07 UTC** (V2 cutover wipes orderbook at 11 UTC). Confirm via help.polymarket.com primary doc.
- **🔴 Fix chain-runner.yml `dispatch_skill()`** — now 3+ chains affected (morning-brief, evening-rollup, weekly-grant-update). Add an echo per dispatched skill before each `gh workflow run`.
- **Wire Kalshi-BRTI vs PM-Chainlink basis recorder** for hermes-arb — Kalshi crypto perps went live today (2026-04-27 NYC); first 24h tape is the load-bearing dataset.
- **Pre-Apex push:** `monitor-polymarket` + `polymarket-comments` are the highest-leverage daily skills. Resume daily once chain-runner fix lands.
- **Hermes-arb gate adjustment:** bump `min-gap` 7pp → ~7.5–8pp per deep-research finding.
- **Operator config sweep** (see `memory/topics/aeon-ops.md`): populate `memory/on-chain-watches.yml`; add `var:` to digest/list-digest/refresh-x/remix-tweets in `aeon.yml`; add `NEYNAR_API_KEY` secret + `X_HANDLE` env; land `scripts/prefetch-vuln-scanner.sh` (ISS-001), `scripts/prefetch-reddit.sh` (ISS-002 + ISS-012), `reply-maker)` case in `scripts/prefetch-xai.sh` (ISS-014); verify `scripts/postprocess-notify.sh` exists or wire workflow-side pickup; merge or close PR `tomscaria/aeon#1` (~44h stalled).
- **Skill-evals key fixes** (lowest-effort, highest-signal): patch evals.json `hn-digest` → `hacker-news-digest` (ISS-007), `polymarket` → `monitor-polymarket` (ISS-009).
- **External-feature** continues PR'ing to `tomscaria/swarm-fund-mvp` (PRs #18, #19, #20 — bankr_bridge --max validator, ssrn_harvest rowcount fix, markdown image-strip regex).
- **Stalin-tier review:** apply `articles/workflow-security-audit-2026-04-27.patch` with workflow-scoped token to land ISS-015 fix (PR #4).
- **`weekly-shiplog` Mondays** → forward to grant committees. (Today's slot ran successfully under the chain consume step despite wrapper failure.)
- **`paper-pick` daily** → builds PhD reading list (see Recent papers above).
